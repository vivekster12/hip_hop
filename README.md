# hip_hop

I found a dataset on hip hop vocab that I found very interesting. It contains the number of unique words an artist has employed in their lyrics (per first 35,000 words of lyrics), the artist name, and the era they belonged to. This got me wondering if there were any trends in the number of unique words for artists across eras. This project explores that trend and tests whether it is statistically significant.
